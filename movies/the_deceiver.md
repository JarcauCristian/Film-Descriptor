Watch the story of Celembrimbor, king of the elves and the greatest smith of that time.
Everything started when a strange elf named Valdis came to Celembrimbor's throne room and offered him as a gift a mithril hammer, the gift bringer also told Celembrimbor that he could show him how to forge artifacts of great power with it. The king accepted Valdis's offer. Under the guidance of Valdis Celebrimbor spent countless months learning and even perfecting the ways Valdis was teaching him.

Using the methods that Celebrimbor discovered, Valdis secretly created a ring shaped artifact that would have made him unstoppable, but it had flaws, so he brought it to Celebrimbor to fix the flaws. When Celebrimbor was close to perfecting the artifact he saw the true power of it and tried to destroy it but Valdis managed to escape with it.

Celembrimbor knew that if he didn't do something the continent would fall to Valdis's might. So he decided to forge a new ring in order to tip the balance of power. After he was ready, Celembrimbor went ahead to confront Valdis and his ring. The battle ultimately ended with the destruction of both rings and their creators thus saving the continent of a ruthless ruler.
